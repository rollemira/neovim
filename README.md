My very own LazyVim configuration ðŸš€

Steps to install:

- get [brew](https://brew.sh)

```bash
# install dependencies with brew
brew install git neovim lazygit warp
# backup your old nvim config
mv ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim_old
# clone this repo to new config
git clone https://github.com/rollemira/neovim.git ~/.config/nvim
```

âœ… Open warp and use nvim!

```bash
# inside warp terminal
nvim
```
